# Your startup name here
**Lib Buddies**

[My Notes](notes.md)

I will be creating a website that allows you to see when people are in the library so you can know if your friends are there to study with. This allows people who aren't close enough to share their location with each other to see when others are studying. The will push a button that will send to everyone in their "buddies" list to tell them that they are now studying at the library. When they leave they will simply just click "leaving" to notify their buddies that they are not longer there. 



> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Studying sucks. Studying alone is worse. It's hard to study at home and annoying to call 50 people to see if they also want to cry in the library. Sharing your location can be a little too personal so what can you do? Use Lib Buddies to send a signal to all of your best or passive friends so that you're never alone in the library! With the click of a button you can notify everyone you want that you are in need of some company at the library. Want a study buddy? A wingman to go talk to that special someone on the second floor? Lib Buddies can help.
