# Lib Buddies


[My Notes](notes.md)

I will be creating a website that allows you to see when people are in the library so you can know if your friends are there to study with. This allows people who aren't close enough to share their location with each other to see when others are studying. The will push a button that will send to everyone in their "buddies" list to tell them that they are now studying at the library. When they leave they will simply just click "leaving" to notify their buddies that they are not longer there. 



> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Studying sucks. Studying alone is worse. It's hard to study at home and annoying to call 50 people to see if they also want to cry in the library. Sharing your location can be a little too personal so what can you do? Use Lib Buddies to send a signal to all of your best or passive friends so that you're never alone in the library! With the click of a button you can notify everyone you want that you are in need of some company at the library. Want a study buddy? A wingman to go talk to that special someone on the second floor? Lib Buddies can help. 

### Design

The top image shows how the login page will look. It will be a simple design with just the app title and a username and password section. The second picture is the main page which will feature the user's profile picture and a button for if the user is in the library or not. Underneath it will have a list of people who are in the library. The last page will be the search page which will allow the user to find and remove buddies. 


### Key features

- Secure login over HTTP
- Buddy list (think friends on Facebook)
- Add/Remove buddy button
- Buddies are notified of user location when at library
- Library announcement button
- Real time notifications of buddies in the library
- Friends are stored permanatly until deleted

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses HTML structure for application. There will be a login, friends search list, and library button page.
- **CSS** - Application styleing that works with different screen sizes and uses good color choice.
- **React** - Provides login, library alert button, adding/removing "buddies", rounting and componants.
- **Service** - Backend service for: login, searching buddies and finding buddies, third party call to location services.
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, stores users in library/out of library. Credentials stored in database.
- **WebSocket** - As each user presses the library alert button- their buddies are notified.
